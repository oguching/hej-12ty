title: About me
layout: layouts/page.njk
---

I am a front-end developer and I made this site.

Hej is Hello in Swedish, Polish, Hungarian and a few [other European languages](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hej).

### List
* I like to play simple games
* I love to play with my gorgeous nieces. Let me tell you, nieces are the best.
* That's pretty much it, I love to play.

> Faith knows that despite appearances, all is well.

That quote about faith is one of my favourite quotes.

That was a bearly visible horizontal line.

### Images
Now on to images, how will we still them?

Looking good.
Now how about code?

### Code

```js
	function foo(bar) {
		const meaningOfLife = 42;
		const lives = 1;

		return meaningOfLife + bar(lives);
	}

	console.log(foo(bar))
```

### Layout Overflow
For some reason, having the pre tag on this page causes the page to overflow and not be contained in the container width. For the life of me I can't figure out why this happens. I only know that when I remove the pre tag everything works as it should.

On desktop it looks fine, but on my phone it overflows sideways.

This is driving me crazy.
