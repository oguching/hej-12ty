## Now

What I am doing now.

Todo:
 - work on blog navigation (previous and nekst link)
 - work on listing all blogs. I guess the archive page and /blog page should point to the same place
 - work on post title and date. Make them closer.
 - make colors in style.css more uniform. Use HSL for everything or pick something and stick with it.
 - launch v1 before August.
