Long time ago in a galaxy far far away.

The Little details will kill you.

Here are a few things I need to fix

- the archives button on the front page does not work
- I want to limit the number of posts that render on the home page to be 5 latests in reverse chrono order
- previous and next buttons not functioning atm
- styling around the post headers. Make date closer to title and find a place for tags except the `posts` tag
