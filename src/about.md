I am a front-end developer and I made this site.

Hej is Hello in Swedish, Polish, Hungarian and a few [other European languages](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hej).

### List
* I like to play simple games
* I love to play with my gorgeous nieces. Let me tell you, nieces are the best.
* That's pretty much it, I love to play.

> Faith knows that despite appearances, all is well.

That quote about faith is one of my favourite quotes.
